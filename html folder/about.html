            My name is <strong>Ogumeyo Ajirioghene</strong>. I'm a passionate developer with over three years of experience in Flutter, building mobile apps with Google Maps, RESTful APIs, and state management (Provider). I also have more than a year of experience in Node.js, including a six-month internship, with projects available on GitHub. My skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Machine Learning are less than a year, with a resume project showcasing my web abilities, while I continue to grow in Python and ML. I am committed to continuous learning and excited about solving real-world problems through technology.
